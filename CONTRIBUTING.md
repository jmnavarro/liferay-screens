## Making Contributions

If you know the feature that you want to add, and how to add it, follow these steps:

1. Add your new feature as a Story to [our issue tracker](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LMW/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). Describe the intention, benefits, and details of your feature. Also make sure to associate your feature with one specific Epic.

2. Create a branch for your feature.

3. When you make commits, prefix the commit message with LMW-xx, where xx is the Story number in the issue tracker. Try to arrange your commits in such a way that revisions are easier to make.

4. Push your branch to your repository and create a pull request to the `master` branch.

## Determining Your Contributions

What happens when you want to make a contribution, but you're not sure about it, or you don't know how to implement it? No problem! One thing you can do is open a thread in [our forum](https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/42706063). We're always happy to discuss new ideas.

If you have a good idea for a feature but don't know how to implement it, you can add a Feature Request to [our issue tracker](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LMW/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). When doing so, be sure to describe the benefits of the feature and why you think it's useful. We'll then review and prioritize the feature.
