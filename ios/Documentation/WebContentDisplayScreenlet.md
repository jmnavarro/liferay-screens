The Default theme uses a standard `UIWebView` to render the HTML. Other themes may use a different component, such as iOS 8's.

## Portal Configuration

For the `WebContentDisplayScreenlet` to function properly, there should be web content in the Liferay instance your app connects to. For more details on web content, please refer to the [Web Content Management](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/web-content-management) section of the Liferay User Guide.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
| `groupId` | `number` | The site (group) identifier where the asset is stored. If this value is 0, the `groupId` specified in `LiferayServerContext` is used. |
|  `articleId` | `string` | The identifier of the web content to display. You can find the identifier by clicking *Edit* on the web content in the portal. |

## Methods

| Method | Return | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
|  `loadWebContent()` | `boolean` | Starts the request to load the web content. The HTML is rendered when the response is received. Returns `true` if the request is sent. |

## Delegate

The `WebContentDisplayScreenlet` delegates some events to an object that conforms to the `WebContentDisplayScreenletDelegate` protocol. This protocol lets you implement the following methods:

- `- screenlet:onWebContentResponse:`: Called when the web content's HTML is received.
- `- screenlet:onWebContentDisplayError:`: Called when an error occurs in the process. The `NSError` object describes the error.
