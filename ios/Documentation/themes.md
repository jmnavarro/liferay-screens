# Themes in Liferay Screens for iOS

## Important Note

*This product is under heavy development and its features aren't ready for use in production. It's being made public only to allow developers to preview the technology*.

## Introduction

This document explains the basics of how themes are designed in Liferay Screens for iOS. Liferay provides a limited set of themes, but additional ones can be created and contributed to the community.

## Installing Themes

Right now, to install a theme in your app you just need to drag and drop the theme's folder into your project. Liferay Screens detects the new classes and then applies the new look and feel, in both the Interface Builder and runtime.

As soon as CocoaPods is ready to work with Swift, it will be possible to simply publish a new recipe for your theme. Users will then be able to install new themes by just adding a new line in their `Podfile`.

## Using Themes

To use themes, it's as simple as setting the `themeName` property in your Interface Builder. If you leave this property empty or type a wrong name, the Default theme will be used.

## Available Themes

- **Default**: The standard theme that is used when you insert any screenlet on your screen.
- **Flat7**: A sample theme intended to demonstrate how to develop your own theme from scratch.
