# Liferay Screens for iOS Library

## Introduction

This is the library that contains all available screenlets for 
iOS. It also includes the infrastructure classes required to develop and 
contribute new screenlets. Note that this library is developed using iOS 8, so 
you'll need XCode 6 and Swift in order to develop your own screenlets.
