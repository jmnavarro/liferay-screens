# How to add Push Notifications support to your Android project

To support Push Notifications ([GCM](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/)) in your Android project there are several steps you will have to follow.

## Create a Google Project and enable Push

First we will have to create a Google project, generate a `SENDER ID` and an `API key` and enable Push Notifications. Let's see how can we do it:

* First, you have to enter in the [developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a project. After creation, the `project number` (next to your project id) will act as our `SENDER_ID`.

* You will have to enable Push Notifications, go to `APIs & auth`, `APIs`, `Cloud Messaging for Android` and click on `Enable API`.
* After enabling Cloud Messaging we need a server key. You can easily create one from `APIs & auth`, `Credentials` and `Create new Key` (Server Key), just select `Create` and copy the `API Key` string, it will act as our `API Key` in our Liferay Portal.

Copy those two keys because we are going to use them on later steps.

## Install and configure Liferay Push in Liferay Portal

Luckily for us there is a [plugin](http://www.liferay.com/es/marketplace/-/mp/application/48439053) that streamlines all the server configuration.

Just install that plugin and configure (through the control panel) the `API Key`, using the server key we generated in the previous steps.

Our server is now ready to notify Android applications (and with few configuration steps more it'll be able to send to iOS applications, Windows Phone and SMS)

## Using Liferay Push in your Android Application

We offer a [Liferay Push Client for Android](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-push-android) that streamlines all complex flow of registering a device for receiving and sending push notifications.

All the required steps are explained in detail in the [documentation](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-push-android) but we'll highlight the important steps:

* Add a new gradle dependency to Android Push

	```groovy
	dependencies {
	
		...
		
		compile 'com.liferay.mobile:liferay-push:1.0.2'
	}
	```
	
* Register your device in GCM with your sender id (the project number, generated in previous steps):

	```java
	Session session = new SessionImpl(YOUR_SERVER, new BasicAuthentication(YOUR_USER, YOUR_PASSWORD));
	
	Push.with(session).register(this, YOUR_SENDER_ID);
	```
	
	or easier if you are already using Liferay Screens:
	
	```java
	Push.with(SessionContext.createSessionFromCurrentSession()).register(this, YOUR_SENDER_ID);
	```

* And that's all! you can attach a listener to store the registration id or to process the notification sent to the activity (setting `onPushNotification()`). You can also register a receiver and service to process the notification (as shown in the example project).

We recommend using the [`PushNotifications`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples) project as a template, specifically the `PushActivity` class.

## Using Liferay Push in your server

It's really easy to send notifications to your Android users from Liferay Portal. Using the Push Notification plugin it's just a matter of sending the user ids and the message content:

```java
PushNotificationsDeviceLocalServiceUtil.sendPushNotification(userIds, content);
```

We have created a full example of using a [hook](https://www.liferay.com/es/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/customize-and-extend-functionality-hooks-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en) to send a push notification each time a user creates a new DDL record or updates one existing. It's available [here](https://github.com/nhpatt/push-with-ddl-hook).

Remember that the new project should depend on the push-notifications-portlet (in `liferay-plugin-package.properties`)

```xml
required-deployment-contexts=\
    push-notifications-portlet
```

and link your Java class with the model you want to listen, for example:

```xml
value.object.listener.com.liferay.portlet.dynamicdatalists.model.DDLRecord=com.liferay.push.hooks.DDLRecordModelListener
```
